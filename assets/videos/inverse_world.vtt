00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
On entering the game

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First you'll see a novice guide

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
A general introduction to the game procedure

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Next there is the Main Scene of game

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
By scanning the marker

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You'll see the main character of game

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
who we call "Inverse Phantom" (in the settings she grows in a counter-chronological manner)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
(Enter the player's name)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
On the bottom, there are buttons with which players can manipulate the emotional expression of the character

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
When you tap the phantom you can chat with her

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and get to know her stories ("Clues") to drive the game forward

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Sometimes in the dialog you feedback with your own words

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
(meaning in other time you do so by clicking on)

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
While chatting with the phantom your energy gets consumed

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:24.000
When it expires you replenish by pushing 3rd button on the left

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
To enter a mini-game to feed your phantom

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
First you select points & scan marker

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
On the magic totem it shows points selected just then

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
By shooting them at certain accuracy you'll gain energy

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
The mini-game can be played 24 times a day

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
The record is updated everyday at 24.00

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Note that the points selected will appear different from those unselected

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
When all points on a screen is all selected more than once, it shows a hint for the inference game (explained later)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(...now we are playing hard for the hint)

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
When the hint pattern is shown, there also appears an arrow button on the left to access the detail

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Since now the energy is replenished you can continue the dialog

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
There are 5 levels in game, you obtain a fixed number of clues in a level

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000
When all clues are gathered in a level there pops up a reminder. It is time to enter the Inference Scene

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to "pair" the clues

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Select a single clue to see the detailed story

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:32.000
By selecting a few and push "Finish", the pairing is done & a new clue is generated

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
When all the possible pairings are done in a level, you'll enter the transition animation

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Push "Return" to return Main Scene

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Once again you can continue the dialog with our heroin to gain clues for the new level

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The novice guide is always accessible on the top left of screen

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
in case you forget about the gameplay

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:43.000
After passing several levels the character will grow down to a younger age

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
the interaction is just similar
