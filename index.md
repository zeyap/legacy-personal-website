I am a senior year undergraduate in Zhejiang University, with a major in Psychology and a minor in Digital Media.

I make [video games](/portfolio/) for entertainment as well as educational purpose. I am curious about good ways of gamification and constantly think of possibilities of psychological knowings applied in digital products.

I do research on design. My previous studies aimed to improve ways of [gestural interactions](/portfoliowork/2015/07/30/User-Defined-Gestures-for-Interaction.html) and [layout of print](/portfoliowork/2016/07/01/Safety-Card.html), through behavioral experiments. I became adept in eye-tracking as a research method through a research on category learning.

At my leisure I enjoy films, animation and comics. I sing and self-teach guitar. I am quite good at [drawing](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=11717862) and long-distance running.
