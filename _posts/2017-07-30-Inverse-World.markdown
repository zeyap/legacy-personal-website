>'Inverse World' is a story-driven AR game, where players explore the game subject's memories through dialogues to help fulfill her wishes. The project is still under way.

<h3>Game conception</h3>

We were required to develop an Augmented Reality game.

After brainstorming on the game design, we primarily decided on a **life simulation** experience on mobile devices.

<h4>Target audience</h4>
Since we are going to iterate and test the games on campus, we largely see university student as the target. No gender preference.

<h4>AR element</h4>
We make use of the virtual *social* experience of AR by making a life simulation mechanism
* Create visual relations between game character with real life objects

To further connect this experience with players' real life ~~(discarded temporarily for the departure from the core theme of game)~~
* Use pedometer and directly transfer stats to bonus in game, driving players to make more physical movement
* Use other capabilities on cell phones, like audio recording, to allow for engaging multi-modal interaction]

<h4>How is it special among it counterparts on the market?</h4>
Due to our love for engaging stories and role-playing interactive novels, we decided to make a girl simulation game *driven by story*. Impressive predecessors among non-AR games are *Life is Strange* and *To the Moon*. 

<h3>Gameplay</h3>

The main character is a ghost who seeks help from the player to explore into her vague memories and find about her goals.
* The game mainly consists of dialogues between the AR character and player, where the players accumulate fragments of her life stories, in a counter-chronological order.

* The player has to infer about the connections among the story fragments of the ghost, and pair them on the interface. Once the paring is successful, the player moves on to the next level.

<h3>Stat balance</h3>

Both the chance for dialogues and fragments-pairing is limited by a energy parameter. To replenish energy of the character, players can
* Feed the character in mini-game
