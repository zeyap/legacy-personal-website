>'Inverse World' is a story-driven AR game, where players explore the game subject's memories through dialogues to help fulfill her wishes. The project is still under way. [project page](https://github.com/fish1996/AR-Game---Inverse-World);

<h2>Game Conception</h2>

In the course *Computer Game Programming* we were required to develop an Augmented Reality game. After brainstorming on the game design, we primarily decided on an experience with **life simulation**, in which players can interact with the character on his cell phone.

<h3>Major Concerns</h3>

<h4>Who is it targeted at?</h4>
Since we are going to iterate and test the games on campus, we largely see university student as the target. No gender preference.

<h4>How is AR making it fun?</h4>
In the first place, we focus on the virtual **social** experience AR can offer by making a life simulation mechanism.

Also, we try to connect this experience with the real life of player, that is, to drive our players out of simply sitting in front of PC or playing on mobile phone. To achive this we proposed to
* Create visual relations between game objects with real life objects (like most AR games do)
* Use pedometer and directly transfer stats to bonus in game
* Use other capabilities on cell phones, like audio recording, to allow for multi-modal interaction

<h4>How is it special among it counterparts on the market?</h4>
Due to our love for engaging stories and role-playing interactive novels, we were making a girl simulation game **driven by story**, rather than another 'virtual daughter/girlfriend' game (could be a limitation though :D). Impressive predecessors among non-AR games are *Life is Strange* and *To the Moon*. 

<h3>Iterative Design</h3>

<h4>Stat balance</h4>
