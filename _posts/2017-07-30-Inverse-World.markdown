>'Inverse World' is a story-driven AR game, where players explore the game subject's memories through dialogues to help fulfill her wishes. The project is still under way.

<h2>Conception</h2>

We were required to develop an Augmented Reality game.

After brainstorming on the game design, we primarily decided on a **life simulation** experience on mobile devices.

<h3>Target audience</h3>
Since we are going to iterate and test the games on campus, we largely see university student as the target. No gender preference.

<h3>AR element</h3>
We make use of the virtual *social* experience of AR by making a life simulation mechanism
* Create visual relations between game character with real life objects

To further connect this experience with players' real life 

* Use pedometer and directly transfer stats to bonus in game, driving players to make more physical movement (x)
* Use other capabilities on cell phones, like audio recording, to allow for engaging multi-modal interaction (x)

<h3>Counterparts analysis</h3>
Due to our love for engaging stories and role-playing interactive novels, we decided to make a story-driven simulation game. Most impressive predecessors are non-AR. 

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<h3>Goal of player</h3>

* The main character is a ghost who seeks help from the player (a magician) to explore into her vague memories and find about her innate goal.
* The game mainly consists of dialogues between the AR character and player, where the players accumulate fragments of her life stories, in a counter-chronological order.
* The player has to infer about the connections among the story fragments of the ghost, and pair them on the interface. Once the paring is successful, the player moves on to the next level. 

<h3>Stat balance</h3>

Since it would be no fun given the progress super-easy and resources unlimited, both the chance for dialogues and fragments-pairing are restricted by a energy parameter.

To replenish energy of the character, players can feed the character in mini-game.

For mini-game design, we brainstormed about the likely ability of magicians to properly match the role of players, and finally decided on a shooting game (that would look like magic spelling).

<h2>Development</h2>

Responsible for design & development job related to user interfaces and 2D transition animation.
