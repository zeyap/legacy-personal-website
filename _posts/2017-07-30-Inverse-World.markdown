<h2>Conception</h2>

We were required to develop an Augmented Reality game. After brainstorming on the game design, we decided to create a life simulation & virtual social experience on mobile devices.

Due to thr group's love for engaging stories and role-playing interactive novels, we decided to make a story-driven simulation game. There are already a number of impressive and non-AR predesessors. 

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
		<h3>Goal of player</h3>

<li>The main character is a ghost (we call Inverse Phantom) who seeks help from the player (a magician) to explore into her vague memories and find about her innate goal.</li>
<li>The game mainly consists of dialogues between the AR character and player, where the players accumulate fragments of her life stories, in a counter-chronological order.</li>
<li>The player has to infer about the connections among the story fragments of the ghost, and pair them on the interface. Once the paring is successful, the player moves on to the next level. </li>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
		<h3>Stat balance</h3>

<ul>Since it would be no fun given the progress super-easy and resources unlimited, both the chance for dialogues and fragments-pairing are restricted by a energy parameter.</ul>

<ul>To replenish energy of the character, players can feed the character in mini-game.</ul>

<ul>For mini-game design, we brainstormed about the likely ability of magicians to properly match the role of players, and finally decided on a shooting game (that would look like magic spelling).</ul>
