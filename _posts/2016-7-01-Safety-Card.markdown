>**Safety briefing cards with real photos and cartoon pictures, which is more effective for comprehension?**
>We investigate this by combining the eye-tracking technique and a simulated manipulation task. The work has been accepted by Chinese Journal of Applied Psychology '17. [Full paper (in Chinese)](/assets/files/safety_card.pdf).

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<h3>data research</h3>
* Based on previous research, in civil aviation, passengers' comprehension of cabin safety information could guide their evacuation when facing emergency. 
* The investigation of NTSB showed, passengers who do not read the safety card could get injured in aviation accidents threefold than those who do.

It is of great significance to improve the comprehensibility of airline safety briefing cards.

<h3>market research & research review</h3>
Two forms of safety cards

**Illustration**|**Real photos**
Emphasis on crucial elements to outsrand among irrelevant details acceletares the identification of important details|Pictures of real situations help build mental models & assist scene cognition in manipulation procedures
Reduction of realistic detail improve the instructional effect|More realistic pictures and logical steps in the guide

<h3>Theory hypothesis</h3>
Previous empirical studies on safety card design mainly use materials in a single kind of pictorial realism. What if we combine the advantages of both? The **mixture representation** employs:

**Illustration of irrelevant backgrounds**|**Real pictures of crucial operating items** 
 reduce the distraction from details|help passengers with the picture-item match

 Illustration: Low Realism | Real Photo: High Realism | Mixture: Mid Realism

 We assume the safety cards' level of realism will affect the comprehensibility of them, measured by: 1. Eye-tracking, 2. Simulation operation test performance, 3. Self-report questionaire (System Usability Scale), 4. Interview

<h2>Experiment</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
* Test pictures are adapted to **3 representation styles** of 8 crucial contents from curently used airline safety briefing card of *China Eastern Airlines*
* To ensure the **general comprehensibility** and **equality** (perceptual & information) of all adaptations of original card, materials were evaluated in a focus group of 5(with 3 experienced passengers) and revised the pictures based on comments.
<h3>Procedure</h3>

 ![](/assets/images/safetycards3.png)

**1 Picture viewing**|**2 Simulation operation test**|**3 Subjective assessment (SUS)**|**4 Semi-Structured Interview**
Each participant assigned to one type of representation|With real emergency equipment|Rank usability of the pictures just viewed|Compare between 3-kind pictorials
Eye-tracker recorded|Think-aloud technique||Elaborate problems met
	|Performance rated by 2 experimenters to ensure coding accuracy

<h2>Analysis</h2>
* 40 participants (20 male/ 20 female) were recruited from Zhejiang University
* 4 screened out for eye-movement data loss
{:.side-note}
<h3>Operation Performance</h3>

* Mixture groups had significantly higher accuracy in "oxygen mask" and "safety door" conditions
* Supports that mixture design could possibly help participants conduct correct actions following instructions
<h3>Eye Movement Data</h3>

**Critical areas / AOIs**|**Fixation Time** on AOIs|**Degree of attention** derivative
operation motions, critical equipments & guiding arrows|first fixation duration (FFD)|Fixation Time / AOIs count
|fixation duration (FD)
|fixation count (FC)

* In mixture group, both FD & FC ratios are significantly than other 2 groups, based on statistical result and heat maps
* Bolstered our hypothesis that mixture design improves the comprehensibility by reducing irrelevant & attention-distractive details in background

<h3>Subjective ratings & interview analysis</h3>
 ![](/assets/images/safetycards5.png)
* SUS scores of the mixture group were above 50.9, the critical score based on Scale-grading Standards, except for "safety gates"
* Interview records shows positive feedbacks
* Users show acceptance to this new design
