>**Safety briefing cards with real photos and cartoon pictures, which is more effective for comprehension?**
>We investigate this by combining the eye-tracking technique and a simulated manipulation task. The work has been accepted by Chinese Journal of Applied Psychology '17.

<h2>Literature review</h2>

<h3>data research</h3>
* Based on previous research, in civil aviation, passengers' comprehension of cabin safety information could guide their evacuation when facing emergency. 
* The investigation of NTSB showed, passengers who do not read the safety card could get injured in aviation accidents threefold than those who do.

It is of great significance to improve the comprehensibility of airline safety briefing cards.

<h3>Theory hypothesis</h3>

<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
		Previous empirical studies on safety card design mainly use materials in a single kind of pictorial realism. What if we combine the advantages of both? The <i>mixture representation</i> employs:

<table class="table table-sm">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Illustration of irrelevant backgrounds</th>
      <th scope="col">Real pictures of crucial operating items</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Reduce the distraction from details</td>
      <td>Help passengers with the picture-item match</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

 We assume the safety cards' level of realism will affect the comprehensibility of them, measured by: 1. Eye-tracking, 2. Simulation operation test performance, 3. Self-report questionaire (System Usability Scale), 4. Interview

<h2>Experiment</h2>
<h3>Materials</h3>
* Test pictures are adapted to **3 representation styles** of 8 crucial contents from curently used airline safety briefing card of *China Eastern Airlines*
* To ensure the **general comprehensibility** and **equality** (perceptual & information) of all adaptations of original card, materials were evaluated in a focus group of 5(with 3 experienced passengers) and revised the pictures based on comments.
<h3>Procedure</h3>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
         <h4>1 Picture viewing</h4>

         <h4>2 Simulation operation test</h4>
		 <li>With real emergency equipment</li>
		 <li>Think-aloud technique</li>
		 <li>Performance rated by 2 experimenters to ensure coding accuracy</li>
        </div>
		<div class="col">
         <h4>3 Subjective assessment (SUS)</h4>
		 <li>Rank usability of the pictures just viewed</li>
		 <li>Think-aloud technique</li>

        </div>
		<div class="col">
		40 participants (20 male/ 20 female) were recruited from Zhejiang University, 4 were screened out for eye-movement data loss
		<h3>Operation Performance</h3>
<li>Mixture groups had significantly higher accuracy in "oxygen mask" and "safety door" conditions</li>
<li>Supports that mixture design could possibly help participants conduct correct actions following instructions</li>
