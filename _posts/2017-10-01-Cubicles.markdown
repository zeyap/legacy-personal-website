Spatial visualization skills (the ability to understand the visual and spatial relationship among objects) are crucial  to reasoning and solving complex problems in STEM disciplines, according to a number of studies.

To effectively evaluate and prepare students'spatial visualization skills for their future STEM coursework and careers, in previous attempts, scalable online traning platform were built by researchers in University of Illinois, but they reported low retention rate of such platform. 

To intrinsically motivate students to train their spatial visualization skills, a solution that has received much popularity is gamification, which has the potential to highten levels of motivation and engagement.

The premise of the game is that the player is trapped in a dungeon maze. To escape, the player needs to navigate through the maze and unlock all the rooms; finishing the game task in the room is the only way to unlock the door to the next room.

<h2>Platform Features</h2>

* Designed modularly, game modules can be added or removed easily by communicating through documented API, maze map can be modified through a single JSON file

* 8 game modules based on 5 major aspects of spatial visualizations skills, with levels of graudual progression

**Block Builder**|3D object visualization & manipulation|2D to 3D transformation
**Constructive Solid Geometry**|3D object visualization & manipulation|Perspective Taking
**Plane Exploration**|3D object visualization & manipulation|Perspective Taking
**View Point**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Shape Revolving**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Flat Pattern**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Transformation Limitation**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation/ Mental Rotation
**Cube Shift**|spatial memory|

* Platform collects in-game behavior in detail to infer a player's problem-solving strategy and react by adjusting game difficulty or repeating failed challenges

<h2>Game Module Design</h2>

<h3> Shape Revolving </h3>
<h4>Educational Goal</h4>

The Shape Revolving game is a gamified adaptation of "Rotation of Objects about Axes" in Sorby's book. 
![](/assets/images/shape revolving1.png)

The game emphasizes 2D to 3D transformatio, aiming to improve players' understanding of surfaces and solids from revolution. The player needs to envision the relationship between 3D objects and 2D shapes, mentally revolve a 2D shape about an axis, and visualize the created 3D model. 

<h4>Gameplay</h4>

In this game, the player is shown a 2D shape as well as a 3D object generated by revolving it. The goal is to identify which axis the 2D shape revolved around to generate the 3D model.

An advanced level of this game shows 4 pairs of shapes and object simultaneously. Objects gradually move into the screen center, where they disappear and one miss will be recorded. The gameplay thus requires players to respond at a faster speed. The player completes a level once the number of successful attempts reaches a certain threshold.Since this level of game uses the same set of questions, it functions as a revision of previous questions, thus may further improve studentsâ€™ understanding of the topic.

<h3> Cube Shift </h3>

<h4>Educational Goal</h4>

The game aims at memory aspect of spatial abilities. It taps into two strong indicators of spatial abilities, working memory span and short-term memory (Miyake, et al., 2001), by requiring students to direct their attention to the image on the cubes regardless of the distraction of shifting movement, and to retain memory of previous configurations of the cube. 

<h4>Gameplay</h4>

The player sees a 3D grid with 3 (or more) cubes that shift position a specific number of times. There is an emoji on one of the cubes and it can move to another cube when two cubes' faces touch, until it disappears when the shift sequence ends. The subject is asked to find where the emoji last appeared n steps earlier in the sequence of shifts. 

Different levels of game manipulate the factor n, number of cubes and number of shifting steps for varied levels of difficulty. 

The game design resembles the n-back tasks by Wayne Kirchner, where the subject is presented with a sequence of stimuli, and the task consists of indicating when the current stimulus matches the one from n steps earlier in the sequence. It also resembles Dot Memory task that taps into STM (participants briefly view a 2D grid with dots shown in sequence inside of it, after the dots disappear they indicate the dot locations in an answer grid).

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h3> Iterative design & Development </h3>

We iteratively modified and improved our design. Our team met with a group of testers weekly and adjusted the difficulty level for each game module and implemented a detailed tutorial system.

<h3> Formal evaluation </h3>

We recruited 10 freshmen (5 male and 5 female) by sending out study invitations for a spatial visualization training game via email to students in entry-level engineering graphics courses. All were compensated with $15 for their participation.
