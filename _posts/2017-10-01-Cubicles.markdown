<h2>Research</h2>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

Spatial visualization skills (the ability to understand the visual and spatial relationship among objects) are crucial to reasoning and solving complex problems in STEM disciplines. In previous attempts, scalable online traning platform were built by researchers in UIUC, but they reported low retention rate of such platform.

<h3>Literature Review</h3>
* To intrinsically motivate students to train their skills, a popular solution is gamification. Gamification can introduce higher levels of motivation and engagement than traditional instructional methods *(Boyle, Elizabeth A., et al., 2012; McClarty, Katie Larsen, et al., 2012)*
* Different academic fields in STEM emphasize different aspects of spatial visualization skills *(Sorby, Sheryl A., 2009)*

<h3>Insights</h3>
<h4>Student Needs</h4>
* The targeted engineering students need to improve all aspects of their spatial visualization skills through training on our platform
* The platform should be fun enough for the students, so that they will voluntarily keep training

<h4>Instructor Needs</h4>
* Instructors may need to write their customized content to cater to their students' need
* Instructors also need fine-grained information on learners' behavior and problem-solving strategies

<h4>System Needs</h4>
* We will gamify the online workshop into a scalable gaming platform, to make it more engaging and effective for instructional purpose
* The platform need to address all 5 major aspects of spatial visualization skills: *3D object visualization & manipulation*, *perspective taking*, *mental rotation*, *2D to 3D transformation*, and *spatial memory*.
* The system should allow the platform to compose the most suitable learning materials for game players from different disciplines
* It may generate feedback on learners' behavior to the instructors

		<h3>The Platform</h3>

		<h4>Game Setting</h4>
		The player is trapped in a dungeon maze. To escape, the player needs to navigate through the maze and unlock all the rooms; finishing the game task in the room is the only way to unlock the door to the next room.

		<h4>Modular Design</h4>
		8 game modules based on 5 major aspects of spatial visualizations skills, with levels of graudual progression. The game system was designed so that game modules can be added or removed easily by communicating through documented API, maze map can be modified through a single JSON file.

		<h4>Behavior Data Collection</h4>
		Platform collects in-game behavior in detail to infer a player's problem-solving strategy and react by adjusting game difficulty or repeating failed challenges.

		 <h3>Cube Shift </h3>
<p>According to working memory span and short-term memory are two strong indicators of spatial abilities,(Miyake, et al., 2001). Thus my first game aims at memory aspect of spatial abilities. </p>

	<h4>Ideation 1: Navigation in a labyrinth</h4>
	<img src="/assets/images/dungeon_prototype.gif">

</div>
<div class="col">
<h5>Gameplay</h5>
The player is faced with a labyrinth on the plane, his goal is to look at a 2D map of his target, memorize the map, and finally go inside the labyrinth to look for the targets. Once player reaches the right position, the target will appear.
The game requires students to:
<p>
<li>Navigate in a 3D space </li>
<li>keep the memory of target position on a 2D map</li>
<li>visualize the target position in the labyrinth from the 2D map</li>
</p>
<h5>User Testing</h5>
<p>Our team met with a group of testers weekly. According to their opinions and misunderstanding while using the prototype, we made adjustment on the prototypes.</p>

In the iteration, this game design was thought of as too difficult, due to the heavy load on memory. But the ideas were later inherited by the design of the dungeon and by ideation 2.

		<h4>Ideation 2: Cube Shift V1.0</h4>
		<img src="/assets/images/cubeshift_prototype.gif"> 
		<i>Mid-Fi prototype made with Unity 3D</i>
		</div>
		<div class="col">
		<h5>Gameplay</h5>
		<p>In the game, the player aims to keep track of a target object in one of the cubes. Cubes will shift in the scene, and the target disappears by some rule. This is where the players' working memory is challenged.</p>
 
		<p>The game requires students to direct their attention to the image on the cubes regardless of the distraction of shifting movement, and to retain memory of previous configurations of the cube.It resembles the n-back tasks by Wayne Kirchner, and Dot Memory task that tap into STM.</p>

		Still, the game, even at the easiest level, was considered too complex to follow the instruction by some users.

		<h4>Design Decisions</h4>
		<li>Lower the difficulty in easy levels, so that players have time to familiarize with the gameplay and do not give up at initial difficulty</li>
		<li>Clarified the expressions of in-game instructions; a detailed explanation(as right illustration shows) could be accessed at any time</li>

		</p>
		<p>The second game is a gamified adaptation of <i>Rotation of Objects about Axes</i> on previous online platform. It aims to improve players' understanding of surfaces and solids from revolution. To succeed in the game, players have to mentally revolve a 2D shape about an axis and visualize the created 3D model.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Formal evaluation</h3>

**PARTICIPANTS** 10 freshmen (5 male and 5 female) were recruited by sending out study invitations to students in entry-level engineering graphics courses. All were compensated with $15 for their participation.
{:.sidenote}

The focus of our analysis was 
* To determine if players' spatial visualization skills (measured by PSVT:R) were associated with their in-game player behaviors (time spent in a level & errors) and and number of completed levels
* To assess player's impressions of our game platform
