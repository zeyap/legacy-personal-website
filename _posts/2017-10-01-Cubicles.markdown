Spatial visualization skills (the ability to understand the visual and spatial relationship among objects) are crucial to reasoning and solving complex problems in STEM disciplines.

In previous attempts, scalable online traning platform were built by researchers in UIUC, but they reported low retention rate of such platform. To intrinsically motivate students to train their skills, a popular solution is gamification.

		<h3>The Platform</h3>
		<h4>Gameplay</h4>
		<li>The player is trapped in a dungeon maze. To escape, the player needs to navigate through the maze and unlock all the rooms; finishing the game task in the room is the only way to unlock the door to the next room.</li>
<li>8 game modules based on 5 major aspects of spatial visualizations skills, with levels of graudual progression</li>
<h4>Features</h4>
<li>Designed modularly, game modules can be added or removed easily by communicating through documented API, maze map can be modified through a single JSON file</li>
<li>Platform collects in-game behavior in detail to infer a player's problem-solving strategy and react by adjusting game difficulty or repeating failed challenges</li>

		 <h3>Cube Shift </h3>

The game aims at memory aspect of spatial abilities. It taps into two strong indicators of spatial abilities, working memory span and short-term memory (Miyake, et al., 2001), by requiring students to direct their attention to the image on the cubes regardless of the distraction of shifting movement, and to retain memory of previous configurations of the cube. 

The game design resembles the n-back tasks by Wayne Kirchner, and Dot Memory task that tap into STM.

		 <h3>Shape Revolving </h3>

The Shape Revolving game aims to improve players' understanding of surfaces and solids from revolution. The player needs to mentally revolve a 2D shape about an axis, and visualize the created 3D model. 

It is a gamified adaptation of "Rotation of Objects about Axes" in Sorby's engineering graphics workbook.

<h2>Evaluation</h2>

<h3>Iterative design & Development </h3>

We iteratively modified and improved our design. Our team met with a group of testers weekly and adjusted the difficulty level for each game module and implemented a detailed tutorial system.

<h3>Formal evaluation</h3>

**PARTICIPANTS** 10 freshmen (5 male and 5 female) were recruited by sending out study invitations to students in entry-level engineering graphics courses. All were compensated with $15 for their participation.
{:.sidenote}

The focus of our analysis was 
* To determine if players' spatial visualization skills (measured by PSVT:R) were associated with their in-game player behaviors (time spent in a level & errors) and and number of completed levels
* To assess player's impressions of our game platform
