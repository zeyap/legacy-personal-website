Spatial visualization skills (the ability to understand the visual and spatial relationship among objects) are crucial  to reasoning and solving complex problems in STEM disciplines, according to a number of studies.

To effectively evaluate and prepare students'spatial visualization skills for their future STEM coursework and careers, in previous attempts, scalable online traning platform were built by researchers in University of Illinois, but they reported low retention rate of such platform. 

To intrinsically motivate students to train their spatial visualization skills, a solution that has received much popularity is gamification, which has the potential to highten levels of motivation and engagement.

<h2>Platform Features</h2>
* Designed modularly, game modules can be added or removed easily by communicating through documented API, maze map can be modified through a single JSON file

* 8 game modules based on 5 major aspects of spatial visualizations skills, with levels of graudual progression

**Block Builder**|3D object visualization & manipulation|2D to 3D transformation
**Constructive Solid Geometry**|3D object visualization & manipulation|Perspective Taking
**Plane Exploration**|3D object visualization & manipulation|Perspective Taking
**View Point**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Shape Revolving**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Flat Pattern**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation
**Transformation Limitation**|Perspective Taking|2D to 3D transformation/ Mental Rotation
**Cube Shift**|spatial memory|

* Platform collects in-game behavior in detail to infer a player's problem-solving strategy and react by adjusting game difficulty or repeating failed challenges

<h2>Game Module Design</h2>

<h3> Revolution Solid </h3>

In this game, the player is shown a 2D shape as well as a 3D object generated by revolving it. The goal is to infer the configuration of the revolution axis by manually rotating the object to have an all-round observation, then indicate the axis by drawing a straight line on the shape.

The game aims to improve students’ understanding on surfaces and solids of revolution. Students are supposed to envision the relationship between 3D objects and 2D shapes revolved to create it. 

A higher-level version of this game shows 4 pairs of section-and-object on a single screen. Objects keep moving into the screen center, where they disappear. The gameplay thus requires players to respond at a faster speed. Since this level of game uses the same set of questions, it functions as a revision of previous questions, thus may further improve students’ understanding of the topic.


<h3> Cube Shift </h3>

The player will view a 3D grid with 3 (or more) cubes that shift for a few steps. There is an image on one of the cubes and it can transit to another cube when two cubes connect, until it disappears when the cubes stop shifting. The task consists of indicating where the image is n steps of shift earlier. Different levels of game manipulate the factor n, number of cubes and number of shifting steps for varied levels of difficulty. 

The game measures memory aspect of spatial abilities. It taps into two strong indicators of spatial abilities, working memory span and short-term memory (Miyake, et al., 2001), by requiring students to direct their attention to the image on the cubes regardless of the distraction of shifting movement, and to retain memory of previous configurations of the cube. The gameplay resembles the n-back tasks by Wayne Kirchner and Dot Memory task that taps into STM (participants briefly view a 2D grid with dots shown in sequence inside of it, after the dots disappear they indicate the dot locations in an answer grid).
