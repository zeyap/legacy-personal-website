# Revolution Solid

In this game, the player is shown a 2D shape as well as a 3D object generated by revolving it. The goal is to infer the configuration of the revolution axis by manually rotating the object to have an all-round observation, then indicate the axis by drawing a straight line on the shape.

The game aims to improve students’ understanding on surfaces and solids of revolution. Students are supposed to envision the relationship between 3D objects and 2D shapes revolved to create it. 

A higher-level version of this game shows 4 pairs of section-and-object on a single screen. Objects keep moving into the screen center, where they disappear. The gameplay thus requires players to respond at a faster speed. Since this level of game uses the same set of questions, it functions as a revision of previous questions, thus may further improve students’ understanding of the topic.


# Cube Shift

The player will view a 3D grid with 3 (or more) cubes that shift for a few steps. There is an image on one of the cubes and it can transit to another cube when two cubes connect, until it disappears when the cubes stop shifting. The task consists of indicating where the image is n steps of shift earlier. Different levels of game manipulate the factor n, number of cubes and number of shifting steps for varied levels of difficulty. 

The game measures memory aspect of spatial abilities. It taps into two strong indicators of spatial abilities, working memory span and short-term memory (Miyake, et al., 2001), by requiring students to direct their attention to the image on the cubes regardless of the distraction of shifting movement, and to retain memory of previous configurations of the cube. The gameplay resembles the n-back tasks by Wayne Kirchner and Dot Memory task that taps into STM (participants briefly view a 2D grid with dots shown in sequence inside of it, after the dots disappear they indicate the dot locations in an answer grid).
