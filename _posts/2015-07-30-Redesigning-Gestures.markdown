description: "User defined gestures for gestural interaction"

>We extended a hand gesture set to one involving hand and non-hand gestures, in the user-defined approach, combining the indices of gesture frequency, subjective ratings and physiological risk ratings.

**Is body gesture interaction *natural* at all?**

Gestures in HCI at present are unnatural and are difficult to learn and memorize, according to our direct experience of playing Kinect games for a whole week, observations and literature review.

The bad compatibility between gestures and commands can be an issue since its design process. The distinct mental models of interactions between users and designers separate their gesture preferences and result in user unfriendly gesture design.

User-defined approach, first proposed by Wobbrock et al.(2009), was effective for generating gestures that fit users' mental models. It involves 2 phase:

 <div>
    <div id="canvas"></div>
</div>
 <h2>Goal of research</h2>
 * Use the gesture elicitation approach, extend it to other body parts (aside from hand gestures)
 * Improve the validity of rating index, combining: **gesture frequency, subjective ratings, and physiological risk ratings**
<h3>Overview</h3>
  <div>
    <div id="canvas2"></div>
</div>

<h2>Determine command set</h2>

The **most important 15 commands** were selected step-by-step
1. Listed all commands used in past 3D gestural studies
2. Removed tasks that are related to specific contexts, i.e. TV and games
3. 4 expert users ranked commands by importance and frequency in previous studies in 5-point Likert scale. We selected those with importance>3 and frequency>2
4. Surveyed online to select among the remaining commands by importance (M = 3.53, SD = 1.42)
