description: "User defined gestures for gestural interaction"

>We extended a hand gesture set to one involving hand and non-hand gestures, in the user-defined approach, combining the indices of gesture frequency, subjective ratings and physiological risk ratings.

**Is body gesture interaction *natural* at all?**

Gestures in HCI at present are unnatural and are difficult to learn and memorize, according to our direct experience of playing Kinect games for a whole week, observations and literature review.

The bad compatibility between gestures and commands can be an issue since its design process. The distinct mental models of interactions between users and designers separate their gesture preferences and result in user unfriendly gesture design.

User-defined approach, first proposed by Wobbrock et al.(2009), was effective for generating gestures that fit users' mental models. It involves 2 phase:

 <h2>Goal of research</h2>
 * Use the gesture elicitation approach, extend it to other body parts (aside from hand gestures)
 * Improve the validity of rating index
