Global Game Jam is an annually-held 48-hour-hackathon for games.

<h2>Time Wave</h2>

For the first time being a game jammer I was an art designer in the group.

I co-designed a puzzle game where the player is framed for a murder, and thus are to escape from prison to seek defensive evidence for his later trial. At the beginning of the game he is led to find his super power to rewind the time.

Our game was featured on the organizer's ("Taptap") official media site.

<h2>Dating Starts!</h2>

Acted as the leading programmer on my team. We used Unity3D for the development work.

This game aims to present a dating experience. In the process, players can control the status of the boy by balancing his stats among his body parts. The final target is to complete the whole dating and win the girl's heart.
